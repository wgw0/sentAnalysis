# sentAnalysis

Python script that provides sentimental analysis of provided text content.

This was used to analyse qualitative data from think-aloud studies in research for usability evaluations of systems.

## To Run:

- Firstly, ensure you have Python installed. The code should work with Python 3.6 and above.

- You need to have the vaderSentiment library installed. You can install it using pip: `pip install vaderSentiment`

- The `typing` module is included in Python 3.5 and above, so you don't need to install it separately if you're using a modern Python version.

- Have the text data you want to analyse available. In the example, there is a string `"Text to be analysed goes here."` provided as input, replace that with your own text data.

- Then execute the script with `python SentAnalysis.py`
